## MoRedact: A Motion Picture Censorship Application




## Abstract

This project presents an approach towards creating an application that will automate the process of censoring a visual media into a highly regulated version. 
The traditional process involves manual review of long form videos, consuming high amounts of time and resources. Our proposed method splits the content into its constituent visual and audio content and performs censorship on the basis of the desired parameters, where the audio content is checked for undesired words and muted, and the video content is checked for inappropriate/explicit content and activity, and blurred. Additionally, a module to classify the genre of the media has also been implemented. 

Our application has been implemented and found to be highly successful in censorship of standard videos and predict the multi-label genres as well.
