# Datasets

This directory is to represent the datasets used for training and testing processes. Since the entire dataset cannot be displayed as such, only some indicative samples are shown.

For Nudity and Sexual Content, for inappropriate content detection, the custom dataset was created from the LSPD, COCO and NPDI-2k datasets, but due to the nature of the content, those cannot be shown currently.
